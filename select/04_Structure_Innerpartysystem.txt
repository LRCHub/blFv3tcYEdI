Why did you change?
Why did you bend and break?
When the water turned to wine,
Did it feel the same?
Why did you change?
Why did you bend and break?
When the water turned to wine, it never...

You suck the bottle dry
Touch fingers to the night
Feels like I've been here before
Now there's an empty hole where you were long ago
But things are different when you're young.

Why did you change?
Why did you bend and break?
When the water turned to wine, did it feel the same?
Why did you change?
Why did you bend and break?
When the water turned to wine, it never feels the same.

The nights are getting cold
Those faces growing old
And there is nothing you can do
So sing your sad excuses
You've got the scars to prove it
And I'm sure they'll sing along.

Why did you change?
Why did you bend and break?
When the water turned to wine, did it feel the same?
Why did you change? (Why did you change)
Why did you bend and break?
When the water turned to wine, it never feels the same

It never feels the same.

Why did you change?
Why did you bend and break?
When the water turned to wine, did it feel the same?
Why did you change? (Why did you change)
Why did you bend and break?
When the water turned to wine, it never...
When the water turned to wine, it never feels the same.
